## CSS Questions and Answers

### What is the difference between `ems` and `rems`?

`em` and `rem` are the two _relative lengths_ we're likely to encounter most frequently when sizing anything from boxes to text.

- the `em` unit means **"my parent element's font-size"**

- the `rem` unit means **"The root element's font-size"**.

### What is a `clearfix` and why need this?

A `clearfix` is a way for an element to clear its child elements automatically without any additional markup. The clearfix property is generally used in **float layouts where elements are floated to be stacked horizontally**.

The clearfix property allows a container to wrap its floated children. Without a clearfix, a container will not wrap around its floated children and will collapse, just as if its floated children had been positioned absolutely.

```css
.clearfix:after {
  content: '';
  display: table;
  clear: both;
}
```

### Deep Dive into `object-fit` and `background-size`

**Object-fit** - property defines how the content of a replaced element such as `img` or `video` should be resized to fit its container. The default value for `object-fit is fill`, which can result in an image squeezed or, stretched.

- `object-fit: contain` resize the image to fit the aspect ration of its container. if the image's aspect ration doesn't match the container's, it will be either `letterboxed` or resized accordingly

- `object-fit: cover` resize the image to fit the aspect ratio of its container, and if the image's aspect ratio doesn't match the container's, then it will be clipped to fit.

- `object-fit: fill (default)` resize the aspect ration of its container, and if the image's aspect ration doesn't match the container's, it will be either `squeezed or stretched`

- `object-fit: none` won't resize the image


**background-size** - the first difference is that we're dealing with the background, not an HTML (`img`) element.

- `background-size: auto`: will keep the image at its default size

- `background-size: cover`: if the aspect rations are not the same, then the image will be masked to fit

- `background-size: contain`: if the aspect rations are not the same, then the image will be letterboxed

  float: left;
  font-size: 6rem;
  line-height: 0.65;
  margin: 0.1em 0.1em 0.2em 0;
}
```

```html
<p class="has-dropcap">
