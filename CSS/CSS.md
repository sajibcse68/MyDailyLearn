#### What is a `Responsive Web Site`?
- Site designed to adapt its layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based grids, flexible
  images, and CSS# media queries
- Site's layout adapts to the size of the device.
- Content verbosity or its visual delivery may change.

#### Combining selectors
- Element with class selectors (selector.class)
- Child (direct) selector (selector > selector)
- Descendent selector (selector selector)

#### Pseudo-Class Selector
- :link
- :visited
- :hover
- :active
- :nth-child(...)

#### What iss the difference between `width: auto` and `width: 100%` in CSS?

- **width: auto** will try as hard as possible to keep an element the same width as its parent container when additional space is added from margins, padding, or borders.

- **width: 100%** will make the element as wide as the parent container. Extra spacing will be added to the element's size without regards to the parent. This typically causes problems.

#### Box Model
- Essential to understand
    - Prefer `box-sizing: border-box`;  // `box-sizing: content-box`;
    - `border-box` = The elements should have padding and border included in the element's total width and height.
    - `content-box` = The `padding` and `border` properties includes (add) with the `width`. 
- The * (Universal) selector
- Cumulative and collapsing margins
    - Horizontal margins are cumulative (addition)
    - Vertical margins are collapsing (take larger one)
- Content overflow
    - overflow - visible (default), auto (scroll bar), hidden (cut the text outside box)

#### CSS Specificity Value

- Style attribute
- ID
- Class, psuedo-class, attribute
- Elements

**N.B:** top to bottom -> most-specificity to least-specificity  

See [CSS specificity calculator](https://specificity.keegan.st/)

#### Positioning Elements by Floating
- Floating elements can produce very flexible layouts
- Floats are taken out of normal document flow
- Floats don't have vertical margin collapse
- To resume normal document flow, use the `clear` property.
    - clear: left/right/both

#### Relative and Absolute Element Positioning
- Static positioning is default for all elements, except html
- Relative positioning offsets the element relative to its normal document flow position
- Absolute positioning is relative to closest ancestor which has positioning set to non-static value
- Offset the relative container element offsets its contents as well.

#### Responsive design (@media)
- Basic syntax of a media query
    - @media (media feature)
    - @media (media feature) logical operator (media feature)
- Remember not to overlap breakpoints
- Usually, we should provide base styling
    - Then, change or add to then in each media query
- Viewport `meta tag` to turn off default mobile zooming
   - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`

- What is `Bootstrap` ?
- Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

#### Bootstrap Grid System
- Structure Bootstrap expects for the grid-based layout
    - Needs to be include .container (or .container-fluid)
    - All columns must be inside .row
- `SIZE` identifier identifies at which breakpoint specified column spans will be ignored and all elements will collapse (i.e., stack)
- If no other rules apply, specifying `col-xs-..` will keep that layout no matter what the size of the screen.

## Mixin
```
// select all the selectors and apply this instead of inheritance
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

// as box-sizing don't be inheritenced so it doesn't work for child of body tag
body {
 box-sizing: border-box;   
}
```
