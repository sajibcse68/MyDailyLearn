## What are the Browser-centric Metrics?

-  **First Byte (TTFB):** It's the time range to get the first byte in api response. The time starts when you click on a link or, navigate to a page.

- **First Paint:** It's the time when browser starts Painting / rendering.

- **Page Load:** When everything is ready on browser (content is loaded 100%) then Page load is fired. The browser is ready to use before page load

Browser-centric metrics are no so important for web performance optimization!


## What are the User Centric Metrics?

- **First Interactive:** means when browser left some room to execute our own codes (e.g. JavaScript) for first time. And then user can interact on browser (e.g. click, drag, scroll, etc.)

- **Speed Index:** measures how quickly content is visually displayed during page load. if you take screenshot of a website over the time when loading. Let's say gmail & amazon have same page load time 1.3 sec but if the amazon speed index is better then that website will feel faster!
