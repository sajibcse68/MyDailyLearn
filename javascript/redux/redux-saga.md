## Redux Saga

- `Redux-sata` is a library that aims to make handling side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching) in React/Redux applications easier & better.
- A saga is like a `separate thread` in our application that's solely responsible for side effect
- Generators are used to make our `async` code look more synchronous making it wasier to read, write, & text
