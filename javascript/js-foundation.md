## JavaScript Engine Workflow

1. JS file pass through Lexical analysis (Parser)
    - Breaks the code into token

2. Token generates a AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
    - go to https://astexplorer.net
3. Pass the AST to Interpreter and output is binary

### What can be problematic for JavaScript Engine

- eval()
- arguments()
- for..in
- with
- delete
 
Tips: always write optimize code that is predictable!

## Memory Heap vs Call Stack

`Memory Heap`: where the memory allocation happens - allocate memory, use memory, release memory
`Call Stack`: keep track where we are in the code so that we can run the codes in order

## How does garbage collection actually works in JavaScript?

- Use [**Mark-and-Sweep**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mark-and-sweep-garbage-collection-algorithm/) algorithm

## What is Memory Leaks?

When `Memory Heaps` is full  (no `garbage collection` is happening, it is called **Memory Leaks**. When memory leaks happens the browser will be crashed!

```js
let array = [];

// infinite loop, memory leaks
for (let i = 2; i > 1; i++) {
  array.push(i);
}

// Event listeners
const element = document.getElementById("button");
element.addEventListener("click", onClick);
// if we back and forth specially in single page application and don't remove event listeners
// then it causes memory leaks

// setInterval
setInterval(() => {
  // referencing  objects...
})

```

## What is Polyfill?

[Polyfill](https://polyfill.io/v3/) is a service which accepts a request for a set of browser features and returns only the polyfills that are needed by the requesting browser

#### Plyfill Necessity

There are lots of differing browsers and browser versions in use throughout the world, each one has a slighly different set of features to the rest. This can make developing for browsers a difficult task. The latest versions of the popular browsers can do lots of things which older browsers can not â€“ but you may still have to support the older browsers. Polyfill.io makes it simpler to support differing browsers by attempting to recreate the missing features with polyfills: You can make use of the latest and greatest features in browsers which support them, and in those that do not.
