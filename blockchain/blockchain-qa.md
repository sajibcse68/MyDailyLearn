#### What is DEX?

DEX stands for `“decentralized exchange”` and refers to a platform that enables the peer to peer trading of digital assets, otherwise known as cryptocurrencies. A DEX runs on a decentralized or ‘distributed’ database, called a `Blockchain`.

Users sign up to a DEX via a web or mobile app. Then, they can use it to exchange digital assets anonymously with other traders all over the globe, 24/7, and in real-time.

Each DEX has many different trading pairs available for exchange, for example, Bitcoin and Ethereum, or XLM and USDT. Because the trades are happening on a decentralized exchange using a blockchain ledger, they happen very quickly, cheaply, and from any location or time zone.
